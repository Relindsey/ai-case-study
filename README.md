# **Genie AI Ltd.: Small AI Company Poised to Upset the Legal Services Landscape**

## **Overview and Origin**
[Genie AI Ltd.](https://us.genieai.co/) (Genie AI) was founded in 2017 by software engineers Rafie Faruq (CEO) and Nitish Mutha (CTO) in 2017 with the express intent of disrupting the current legal industry model. Genie AI raised $4.84 million in 7 rounds, the most recent of which consisting of a £200 thousand grant from the United Kingdom's national business innovation agency, Innovative UK.

## **Business Activities**
Genie AI presents a cost effective platform to access and create AI generated legal documents for lawyers and non-lawyers. Traditionally, contract drafting is a costly, time-intensive process that requires extensive legal knowledge and experience. Genie AI's implementation of GPT-4, Claude 2, and proprietary language models provides its customers with complex legal documents that are analyzed and optimized for their individual needs. Customers can search for specific legal documents and clauses by contract type. Further, the company's AI technology features an AI legal assistant capable of summarizing a legal document in layman terms, extracting the material terms of a document, analysis of each legal clause and identification of the favored party.

Genie AI stands apart from competitors by offering its services in a manner accessible by non-lawyers. The current business model charges customers on a £40 per-document basis rather than a subscription contract. Startup competitors such as [Spellbook](https://www.spellbook.legal/) require a monthly subscription fee more suitable to legal practitioners who will utilize AI assisted legal drafting on a routine basis. Established competitors in the legal document drafting arena, such as LegalZoom, are launching [their own](https://www.legalzoom.com/ai/doc-assist) AI powered document services. However, LegalZoom's AI capabilities are limited to analyzing and providing a summary of legal documents.

Genie AI is well situated to disrupt the legal services landscape and secure a significant hold in the market with remarkably low entry costs. Compared with legal research behemoth Thompson Reuters' recent acquisition of legal AI firm Casetext in June of 2023 for $650 million, Genie AI entered the market for less than one percent of the cost. 

## **Landscape**
Genie AI is engaged in the vast field of online legal services. The online legal service field includes a multitude of areas such as document drafting, legal research, analysis, case management, billing and operations. The legal services market was estimated at [$901 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-legal-services-market) in 2021. 

Over the last five years, companies engaged in the legal services sector have scrambled to adapt to the emergence of AI. Indeed, the two largest online legal research companies, Thompson Reuters (Westlaw) and LexisNexis, seek to maintain their foothold at the top with the former purchasing an operational AI legal research platform and the latter opting to develop its own AI powered legal research tools [in-house](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/pressroom/b/news/posts/lexisnexis-launches-lexis-ai-a-generative-ai-solution-with-hallucination-free-linked-legal-citations#:~:text=LexisNexis%20is%20responsibly%20developing%20legal,or%20reinforcement%20of%20unfair%20bias.).

Genie AI's most formidable competitors will undoubtedly be legacy legal research companies like Thompson Reuters and LexisNexis that are able to expend hundreds of millions of dollars in bringing AI powered products to market. While these companies previously focused on legal research products for legal practitioners, both of these giants are rolling out AI powered platforms that also promise to offer legal document services.

## **Results**
AI enhanced legal services represent a new technology that will become widely used as AI becomes mainstream. Currently, this technology is viewed by the legal profession with both curiosity and [apprehension](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2023/07/13/many-u-k-legal-professionals-expect-generative-ai-to-change-nature-of-client-relationships-397-74770/). According to a recent article published on Law.com's Legaltech news, a survey of legal practitioners in the U.K. suggests companies like Genie AI must work diligently to gain the trust and confidence of customers whose professional reputations depend on the accuracy of their work product.
>Similar to their counterparts in the U.S., U.K. legal professionals are not exactly welcoming the technology with open arms. Two-thirds (67%) of respondents said they had mixed feelings about generative AI, while 61% had some concerns about the ethical implications of the technology on the practice of law, with an additional 26% expressing significant concerns.

Genie AI's results in ensuring accurate legal work is promising. The company's proprietary large language model was able to score in the top ten percent on the Uniform Bar Exam, a feat which outperformed GPT-3. Further, Genie AI is pushing to improve its technology in hopes of [surpassing GPT-4](https://www.businessmole.com/genie-ai-set-to-outperform-gpt-4-with-uks-first-ai-legal-assistant/) by expanding the legal database its technology utilizes. Genie AI's commitment to accuracy will attract business as lawyers begin to adopt AI.

AI powered legal tools are a new technology, with many competitors offering only product demos or sign-up pages to be placed on a wait-list. As a result, traditional metrics like revenue are presently unhelpful in gauging or predicting performance for an AI startup like Genie AI. Exposure metrics provide a better roadmap as encouraging early adoption will be critically important in developing a credible reputation in the market. According to [Crunchbase.com](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ginie-ai/technology), Genie AI has a monthly web traffic of 71,176 visitors and is growing at a rate of 92.1 percent. Compared to startup competitor Spellbook's monthly web traffic of only 1,800 visitors, Genie AI boasts significantly greater exposure to prospective users. Moreover, Genie AI's technology is ready and available for customers to use whereas Spellbook is currently in early access.

## **Recommendations**
As the legal industry adapts to the emergence of AI technologies and begins to adopt in greater numbers, companies like Genie AI will need to offer more than one service to remain competitive and relevant. Large legal research companies like Thompson Reuters and LexisNexis are determined not to be left behind and are leveraging the legal market's familiarity with their brands to seamlessly transition customers to their own AI powered products. These products will undoubtedly include AI assisted legal document drafting services. Therefore, Genie AI would be wise to expand its services to include legal research.

Indeed, if Genie AI truly wishes to disrupt the legal service industry, then it must offer what larger competitors do at a more attractive price. Genie AI's powerful large language model is well suited to the task of providing AI assisted legal research. Genie AI already possesses the technology needed to offer AI powered legal research. Expanding their database to include case law and regulatory statutes would allow Genie AI to compete with larger legal service companies and truly disrupt the industry.
